# Crowdfunding_ETL Project 2
Team Members: Seth Ritter, Erika Walker

# Background
For the ETL mini project, you will work with a partner to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After you transform the data, you'll create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, youâ€™ll upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

# Data Source
Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.

crowdfunding_db:
This is a PostGres database that has the cleaned data in Tables.

crowdfunding_db_schema:
This is the ERD table generated from QuickDB website saved as a .sql file.

ETL_Mini_Project_RSeth_WErika:
This is the Jupyter notebook that holds the python coding where we extracted and loaded the raw data.

Resources holds the original CSV data (crowdfunding, contacts_original) that hasn't been modified and the four new CSV files (campaign, category, subcategory, contacts).
